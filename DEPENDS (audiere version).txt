#Load modules for oss emulation so that /dev/dsp is created:
#as per emeres from <https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=184148>
#Alsa OSS Emulation
#snd-pcm-oss
#snd-mixer-oss
#snd-seq-oss

#or just alsa-oss as per Themaister from <https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=99234>:
alsa-oss
#NOTE: audiere on sourceforge hasn't been updated since 2006, and on [feature request to support alsa](https://sourceforge.net/p/audiere/feature-requests/67/), anonymous coward posted "Whatever, patches welcome"--that was in 2007.
#Poikilos/audiere (fork) does not need also-oss, has changes from the upstream svn repo, and has many modernizations and improvements to the code from other forks and to the build system.
