dxman-crossplatform 

-intended to be the ONLY MAINTAINED version -- it only needs multithreading (see DXManSDL notes)
-is a continuation of the cross-platform dxman-kdevelop which was discontinued in favor of this fork.
-has Sounder for sound management abstraction

"dxman-crossplatform"-specific issues:
-movement does not work correctly--all objects seem to speed away toward infinity & make bumping sound
-sound is not enabled (goal is to use OpenAL)
-some uint32's are UInt32 and some are Uint32
-usage of zRotVelDegreesPerSec is:
	zDegMove=zRotVelDegreesPerSec*rSecondsSinceLastCall
	--this is done by RotateTowardDest(iMillisecondsSinceLastCall)
		OR RotateTowardDest(rSecondsSinceLastCall) [float or double overload] in base.cpp!

Beta:
-check for weird stuff in file called "dat" & check behavior of loading that
-bullets should go away after dying (?)
-test compressed targa loading
-new song for Title screen (before intro text)
-make sound work better - make a queue so that overdue alien ouch doesn't wait to play until letting off mouse button from rapidfire
	-such as global iSoundInstanceTimeToLiveTicks & local iTickGenerated variables
-crashes on boss, reason unknown--about the time when the sound effect should stop, the game crashes (vanishes without windows issue resolution running)

Final
-test compressed targa saving
-use Hermes: OSS pixel format conversion library

-renamed DPOLAROFRECT and FPOLAROFRECT to RConvert_RectToPolar
2011-12-29
-(major fix!) changed "else {" to "if (bHitMinX||bHitMaxX||bHitMinY||bHitMaxY) {" for hit edge in case hit both edge AND bottom!
-(major fix!) changed "if (rSecondsShootDelay<Base_r0)" to "if (rSecondsShootDelay<=Base_r0)"
-changed
		(Base_GetSeconds()-rSecLastRefresh)
	to
		Base_SecondsSince(rSecLastRefresh)
2011-12-24
-got fixed Point2dFrom3dWithScreenOffset with return--pasted from DXManSDL
-changed "for (iNow=0; iNow<iSoundarrLen; iNow) {" to "for (iNow=0; iNow<iSoundarrLen; iNow++) {"
-fixed PointIsInView (used to not do anything if >=)!
-changed includes in "dxman-crossplatform"-specific sourcecode to use new file naming (already done in base [see DXManSDL programming notes])
-made X,Y,Z member variables capitalized
-fixed issues preventing compile
-fixed c-style pointer cast warnings no longer need "(Entity*)" cast since all objects are entities.
-added missing line:
			LoadImage(gbIntroTextBack, "images/intro-text-back.tga");
-made Base_SecondsSince have a return!
2011-12-23 (see DXManSDL)
2009-09 (see also: DXManSDL 2009-09-03)
-improved font.tga (resized&moved letters to keep outlines from crossing divisions)
-fixed infinite recursion in Mass3D::ToString (replaced ToString calls with ExpertMultimediaBase::ToString)
-improved area0000.tga and area0001.tga
-added "no checkpoint reached" to gamescreenarea0000.tga
-refactored to comply with C++ standards (used extern in header instead of declaration except in base.h, and fixed other project layout issues)


2008 (kdevelop version)
-features the ability to load RLE-compressed targa files (resources have been compressed)
-uses objects instead of structs and functions for nearly everything
-added RLE compress/decompress for targa (not tested)
-added font renderer ported from C# RetroEngine (not tested)
