# dxman-crossplatform

- ...was intended to become the main branch--it only needs multithreading (see DXManSDL notes).
- ...is a continuation of the cross-platform dxman-kdevelop which was discontinued in favor of this fork.
- ...has Sounder for sound management abstraction.

## Tasks
### dxman-crossplatform-specific issues
- [] movement does not work correctly--all objects seem to speed away toward infinity & make bumping sound
- [] sound is not enabled (goal is to use OpenAL)
- [] some uint32's are UInt32 and some are Uint32
- [] usage of zRotVelDegreesPerSec is:
  `zDegMove=zRotVelDegreesPerSec*rSecondsSinceLastCall`
  - this is done by RotateTowardDest(iMillisecondsSinceLastCall)
    OR RotateTowardDest(rSecondsSinceLastCall) [float or double overload] in base.cpp!

### Deferred
- [] check for weird stuff in file called "dat" & check behavior of loading that
- [] bullets should go away after dying (?)
- [] test compressed targa loading
- [] new song for Title screen (before intro text)
- [] make sound work better - make a queue so that overdue alien ouch doesn't wait to play until letting off mouse button from rapidfire
  - such as global iSoundInstanceTimeToLiveTicks & local iTickGenerated variables
- [] crashes on boss, reason unknown--about the time when the sound effect should stop, the game crashes (vanishes without windows issue resolution running)
- [] test compressed targa saving
- [] (optional) use Hermes: OSS pixel format conversion library
