
What happened after the FORK between DXManSDL and dxman-kdevelop:

DXManSDL has: 
2009-09-06
-MultiThreading to work around SDL Mixer crashes

2009-09-03
-Scrolling of Text Intro
  -TargaToTarga32_Alpha_Clipped function
    -fixed crash
    -redundant pointer multiplication of unsigned __int32* and redundant unsigned __int32 pixel variable replaced with *(unsigned __int32*)(lpbyDestNow-4)=_RGB32BIT(255,red,green,blue);
    -removed unneccessary intermediate variables and unsigned __int32* pixel building macro in favor of direct value assignment and putting most convenient (even if inconsistent) value into destination alpha channel
    -removed unneccessary pointer addition in favor of adding bytes-per-pixel except when pixel needs to be drawn with alpha
-errant occurances of 256 in alpha formulas replaced with 255
2008
-multiple random burn marks (burn*.tga) instead of just one image
-improved area backgrounds
-intro-text-back.tga and intro-text.tga separate to allow for scrolling (fixed crash in 2009)

TODO:
-copy optimizations in TargaToTarga32_Alpha_Clipped (above) to ALL targa methods
-fix random StopMusic hang
-During "Escape" confirm (pause), aliens don't pause but hero gravity does

dxman-kdevelop has:
-All targa methods moves to targa class
-all (or nearly all) functions encapsulated into classes
-beginning to program environment class to control all object movement and hit detection
