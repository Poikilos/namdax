Always Check
-Remove semicolons from macros if accidentally typed!

ALPHA
-Do not show Anim frame if null, and set gbFrame to null during load
-distribute with DXMan and add link to sourcecode! (listed items)
	'ogg.dll' (the format and decoder)
	??'vorbis.dll' (the coding scheme)
	??'vorbisenc.dll' (tools for encoding)
	and 'vorbisfile.dll 
-soft Quit ([Esc], 'y') does not work (process still runs invisibly)
-fix aiming ellipse w/h ratio (less accurate as hero nears sides)
-make STATUS_SHIELD do something visually (something better than now)
-REPLACE ALL cases of "if (iType=E" with "if (iType==E" !!!
-Check to see if Entity::SetVars is problematic!!! (currently only called through shot array)
-sometimes there is a hero shadow, sometimes not -check constructor (?)
-does not terminate on end game (click makes it disappear, but it is still running in task manager)

BETA:
-target image on enemy if pointed toward enemy (check the z-order on that)
-implement game.dat
-make a shadow mask for each level to prevent shadows on sky
-change readme for new keys
-replace integer sound calls (iPlayBomb etc) with float values ranging from -1.0f to 1.0f
-crashes on exit, (only sometimes, not on defeat?) -- try cleaning up sound chunks?
-change images to png and use SDL_image
-check bQuickAlpha per call instead of per pixel
-comment out any lines that contain "debug only"
-fix lines that say "re-implement"
-change keys in readme (&screens)
-make graphics for Each Level and stage (or create digits 0-9 and number engine) and composite them
-composite life bar background onto backdrop ONCE
-display lives with number engine
-return to first stage of level on death
-unload sound instances after playing them (?)
-add splash screen during slow first load
-add intro (just scroll a tga with words on it) "say it is the year x" where x is the current year plus 20!

FINAL:
-make bombs explode
-deform terrain when bombs hit, and when other entities hit ground
-make moving background (use high-res morguefile.org photos)
-fix any lines that say "Is this right?"
-uncomment error reporting in basefunc and tga.cpp (except lines with ////)
-Make explodedness a per-pixel offset instead of a multiplicative offset.
-Stop music before playing next music file (i.e. trumpet)
-fix "//flip pages" function to allow colorspace conversion
-fix value of REAL_BPP and REAL_BYTEDEPTH when they are set during init
-make sure lptargaBack is drawn when lpddsBackdrop used to be drawn
-replace KEYDOWN with:/*start code*/ SDL_Event event;       /* Check for events: */while (SDL_PollEvent (&event)) {
		switch (event.type) {
            	case SDL_KEYDOWN:
            	    break;
            	case SDL_QUIT:
                		done = 1;
                		break;
            	default:
                		break;
		}
	}
